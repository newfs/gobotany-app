<h1>Whatâ€™s a Dichotomous Key?</h1>

<p>
A <b>dichotomous key</b> presents a set of paired choices that describe
various plant characteristics. To identify a plant, you choose the
description that best matches the plant you are trying to identify. This
leads you to another pair of choices. This process of making selections,
choosing characteristics that best match your plant from a series of
paired options, eventually narrows down to an individual species.
</p>

<p>
The Go Botany Dichotomous Key covers all 3,500 species, subspecies, and
varieties of native and naturalized plants in New England, and is
designed for experienced botanists.
</p>

<p>
While the questions are technical and specific, hundreds of botanical
terms are defined and clearly illustrated. The key is based on New
England Wild Flower
Society's <a href="http://www.nativeplanttrust.org/store/flora-novae-angliae"><i>Flora
Novae Angliae: A Manual for the Identification of Native and Naturalized
Higher Vascular Plants of New England</i></a> (Haines, 2011).
