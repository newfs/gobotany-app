    <h1>About Go Botany</h1>

    <h2>A new flora for New England</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Go Botany is a four-year project funded by the 
        <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0840186"
            >National Science Foundation</a> and aims to open plant study to a 
            larger and more diverse segment of the population.</li>
        <li>The project builds upon the work in our printed manual,
            <em>Flora Novae Angliae</em>,
            by research botanist Arthur Haines. This manual is the first
            comprehensive scientific reference published in the last 25 years
            on the region's plant species, and is available for purchase at
            Native Plant Trustâ€™s

    <h2>The Go Botany toolkit</h2>
        
    <img src="/static/images/layout/about_page_photo1.jpg"
        alt="Two people inspecting and photographing a plant in the woods">

    <ul>
        <li>Our <a href="{% url 'level1' 'simple' %}">Simple Key</a> is an easy to use
            plant identification tool and contains 1,200 of the most common species in 
            New England. Aimed at beginners and professionals, it works by the user answering
            questions, which narrows down the matching selection of plants.
        <a href="{% url 'level1' 'simple' %}">Get started</a>!</li>
        <li>Using our <a href="{% url 'advanced-id-tools' %}">Advanced ID Tools</a>,
            you can use a traditional, albeit electronic, 
            <a href="{% url 'site-help-dkey' %}">Dichotomous Key</a>
            to identify genera 
            within families and species within genera, and more than 3,500 species,
            subspecies and varieties of plants. Or you can use our
            <a href="{% url 'level1' 'full' %}">Full Key</a>, which
            works like the Simple Key, but like the Dichotomous Key, contains more than
            3,500 species.</li> 
        <li>Exploring our species pages,
            <a href="/species/acer/rubrum/">Acer rubrum</a> for example, 
            allows you to learn about the habitats, characteristics, 
            uses of plants, to view photos and maps of their distributions, and much more.</li>

    <h2>Resources for teachers</h2>

    <img src="/static/images/layout/about_page_photo2.jpg"
        alt="An instructor showing a blooming plant to a group of
        children in the garden">

    <ul>
        <li>Go Botany is designed for students and informal learners age 15
        and older, from beginners to professionals. But educators can
        incorporate our tools into lessons for all ages. Develop your own
        curricula, lab modules, and field workshops using Go Botany.</li>
        <li>New England Wild Flower Society is teaming up with three partners,
        <a href="https://www.montshire.org/"
            >Montshire Museum of Science</a>, <a
            href="https://peabody.yale.edu/">Yale Peabody
            Museum of Natural History</a>, and the 
        <a href="https://www.chewonki.org/">Chewonki
            Foundation</a> to create customized floras, educational displays,
        and teaching tools.</li>
        <li>Share your ideas with other educators using 
        <a href="{% url 'ps-main' %}">PlantShare</a> and posting
        to our <a href="{% url 'site-teaching' %}">Teaching</a> page.</li>
        <li>In 2012 and 2013, Native Plant Trust (then named New England
            Wild Flower Society) trained
            educators throughout New England on how to use Go Botany.</li>

    <h2>Technical resources</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Go Botany uses a collection of mature and powerful
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open
            source</a> technologies. The application is written in the
            <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> programming language,
            using the web framework <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">
            Django</a> and the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>
            database system.

        </li>
        <li>The Go Botany application itself is also open source. The source
            code is managed and available on 
            <a href="https://github.com/newfs/gobotany-app">GitHub</a> and has
            attracted the attention of various organizations.

            One, the <a href="https://www.serc.si.edu">Smithsonian Environmental
            Research Center</a>, working with a group of 
            <a href="https://github.com/jazkarta/goorchids-app">web developers</a>,
            used the Go Botany source code to
            <a href="https://northamericanorchidcenter.org/naocc-interactive-website-under-development">
            develop</a> the site
            <a href="https://goorchids.northamericanorchidcenter.org">Go Orchids</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            In addition, without the need to make source code modifications or
            hire web developers, our Go Botany server has the capability to host a
            customized Simple Key, one that includes a subset of New England
            species. For example, for their <em>Early Spring: Henry Thoreau and
            Climate Change</em> exhibit, the
            <a href="https://www.concordmuseum.org/">Concord Museum</a> worked
            with us to develop the <em>Go Botany Concord Flora</em>,
            a comprehensive list of and identification tool for the plants of
            Concord, Massachusetts.
