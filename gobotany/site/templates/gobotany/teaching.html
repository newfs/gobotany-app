    Practice your identification skills with these handy plant quiz cards!
    Even when you cannot get outside or sample live plant specimens, you and
    your students can work with these short descriptions and photographs to
    learn about the process of identifying plants.  Some species are native to
    New England, others considered invasive, so they are good springboards to
    conversation. A key to the species names is included. Have fun, and let us
    know if you use these!

    Here is a handy form that your students can take with them in the field
    when using Go Botany to identify plants. It gives them helpful prompts
    for the observations they should make, and gets them looking carefully.
    It also encourages students to take meaningful photographs of their
    plant, to which they can refer later while identifying plants in the
    classroom. Thanks to Dr. Mario Sousa-Pe√±a, Lead Teacher in Science and
    BHS Lead Mentor at <a
