# Go Botany

[Go Botany](https://gobotany.newenglandwild.org/) is a web site that
encourages informal, self-directed education in botany for science
students and beginning and amateur botanists.

## Running Go Botany on your workstation

First, check out the repository and run `dev/setup` to install the
application and its dependencies in a Python virtual environment (that
lives inside of `dev/venv` in case you ever need to access it):

    git clone git@github.com:newfs/gobotany-app.git
    cd gobotany-app
    dev/setup

Next, make sure that you can access your local PostgreSQL server, which
you can confirm with a quick `psql -l`, and then start up a Solr full
text index server with:

    dev/start-solr

At this point the application should at least run, even though most
pages will give errors if your database is not set up yet.  To start the
application, simply run:

    dev/django runserver

You should then be able to visit the application at:

    http://localhost:8000/

Before importing data into your database, ensure you have your AWS
credentials set in your environment variables, which is often accomplished
by sourcing a shell script kept outside the repository. This is needed to
ensure that image importing will work.

If you are starting fresh and have no database set up yet, or want to
start over because some tables have changed or Sid had released a new
CSV file, then you can rebuild the database with these commands (the
first one will give an error if you do not have a `gobotany` database
already sitting in your way; in that case, ignore the error):

    dropdb gobotany
    createdb -E UTF8 gobotany
    dev/load

At this point you are done installing and should be able to test and
develop the application!

If you ever need to activate the virtual environment so that Python
prompts or scripts run from your shell have access to the Go Botany
application and its dependencies, then enter:

    source dev/activate

If you want to rebuild our minified JavaScript in preparation for a
deploy to production, run:

    dev/jsbuild

Our various tests can be run with three commands:

    dev/test-browser
    dev/test-js
    dev/test-python


## Installing Go Botany on Heroku

Start by checking out this "gobotany-app" repository on your machine:

    git clone git@github.com:newfs/gobotany-app.git
    cd gobotany-app

Follow steps 1â€“3 at `http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart`_
so that you can run the ``heroku`` command, then use the following
command to create and provision a new app on Heroku:

    heroku create
    heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql:basic
    heroku addons:add memcache:5mb
    heroku addons:add websolr:cobalt
    heroku pg:wait
    git push heroku master

Once the Postgres database is up and running, note its color (like "RED"
or "SILVER"), and promote it to being the "main database" for the app:

    heroku pg:promote <color>

Add three configuration variables to your Heroku app, so that Go Botany
will be able to scan its S3 image repository:

    heroku config:add AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
    heroku config:add AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
    heroku config:add AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=newfs

The application will now be up and running.  You can find its URL with
the ``heroku apps:info`` command.  When you visit, you will see an
exception, because the database tables that it needs have not yet been
created.  To set up the database, run these commands:

    heroku config:add DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=gobotany.settings
    heroku run django-admin syncdb --noinput
    heroku run python -m gobotany.core.importer zipimport
    heroku run bin/import-images.sh
    heroku run bin/import-dkey.sh

Prepare Solr:

Visit the Heroku web site, navigate to
your app's configuration, select the addon "Websolr", choose the section
"Advanced Configuration", and paste in the contents of ``schema.xml``
found in the repo's ``dev/websolr_schema`` directory. This file differs a
bit from the one that runs for local development (in the repo's
``/usr/solr-4.7.2/example/collection1/conf/`` directory; compare to see).
The main reason it differs is because Websolr uses a customized directory
structure that differs from the Solr default.

Once the schema is installed (give it a few
minutes to make sure the change has the chance to propagate to WebSolr's
servers), you can build the Solr index and thereby activate the Go
Botany site's search field:

    heroku run django-admin rebuild_index --noinput


## Deploying to the Development server

Log in to Heroku. Ensure you have a git remote set for the gobotany-dev
Heroku application.

Run the following to deploy the develop branch, which is the usual while
in the process of developing for a release:

    git push heroku develop:master

Run the following to deploy the master branch, which you may want to do
upon wrapping up a release (after merging the develop branch in), or to test
patch made to master:

    git push heroku master

Your should rarely need to push out Haystack/Solr schema changes. But, if
you have a new schema.xml file (say, after a Solr upgrade or a customization),
you will need to manually copy and paste the contents of that file into the
Heroku Websolr add-on.

To reindex the Solr index, use the following command:

    heroku run python gobotany/manage.py rebuild_index --app {app-name}

(locally, use: dev/django rebuild_index)


## Running the automated tests

To run our Python tests you can either:

    dev/test-python             # to run all tests
    dev/test-python api site    # to hand-pick Django apps to test

Note: if you get failures with the Python tests, try running the tests
again for just the app where failures occured. There is a known problem
where some tests can fail when running tests for multiple apps at once.

To run our JavaScript tests, run:

    dev/test-js                 # to run all tests
    dev/test-js test/Filter.js  # to select which modules to test

Our selenium-powered browser tests are intended to cover things that
cannot be tested without a browser and JavaScript.  To run them:

    dev/test-browser                           # to run all tests
    dev/test-browser FilterFunctionalTests     # all tests in a test class
    dev/test-browser FilterFunctionalTests.test_length_filter   # single test

Note: if you get failures with the browser tests, try running the test
that failed individually. Sometimes a failure or two occurs when running
the entire suite, but the tests pass when run individually.

Detailed notes about testing under selenium can be found in:

    gobotany-app/gobotany/simplekey/testdir/README-SELENIUM.txt


## Checking test coverage

To check for test coverage using coverage.py, run:

    $ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=gobotany.settings
    $ coverage run --source=gobotany dev/venv/bin/django-admin test
    $ coverage html
    $ open htmlcov/index.html

If you don't specify the --source, you'll have stats for the entire
site-packages directory, the dev directory, etc.

The first pass generates a .coverage text file with coverage statistics.

The second command creates nicely formatted, highlighted, and linked HTML
reports.

To see the same data on the command line, use:

    $ coverage report


## Testing and adjusting the search feature

The Go Botany search feature uses Haystack and Solr.

Our unit and functional tests aim to ensure various aspects of the search
feature including desired ranking.

Ranking relies mostly on Haystack document boost, as seen in several
places in our `search_indexes.py`. For more fine-grained control where
boost is not enough, some hidden repeated keywords are added to search
indexes such as in the `species_text_search_index.txt` template.

To adjust ranking: cycle through running the functional tests, adjusting
the boosts in `search_indexes.py`, and, if necessary, adjusting the
hidden-keyword sections at the end of `search_*.txt` templates. The Solr
Admin full interface, which allows examining details including ranking
scores, may also be helpful:

    http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/form.jsp


## Using the production JS locally

When developing locally, the default is to use the individual
non-minified JS files, as they require no separate build step before
testing.

After working on these JS files, you build the combined and minified
production JS file to be used on the site.

It is a good idea to test with this file to make sure the changes work
as expected. Sometimes things load a bit differently when using this
file, and it can happen that things worked with the individual JS
files fail with the production JS file.

To temporarily use the production JS file, edit the file:
gobotany/app/gobotany/site/templates/gobotany/_js.html

Change the if statement there to evaluate to False, such as with
'if 1 == 0'. Ensure Django reloads (if not, restart Django), then
reload the page.
