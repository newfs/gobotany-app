                                    <li>This key covers all 3,500 species,
                                    subspecies, and varieties of native and
                                    naturalized plants in New England.</li>
                                    <li>It works in the same way as our Simple Key
                                    Plant Identifier, asking you to choose the
                                    broad group your plant is in, then offering you
                                    a series of questions based on the
                                    characteristics you are able to observe.</li>
                                    <li>Because there are many types of plants in
                                    this key, you may take a little longer to
                                    identify your plant, but once you do, you can
                                    get lots of information on each taxon.</li>

                                    choices that describe various plant
                                    characteristics.</li>
                                    <li>You choose the one that best matches the
                                    plant you are trying to identify. Then  you get
                                    another pair of choices.</li>
                                    <li>As you march down the choices, you
                                    gradually narrow down to your plant.</li>
                                    <li>The questions are technical and specific,
                                    but botanical terms are all defined and
                                    illustrated.</li>
