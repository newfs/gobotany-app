GO BOTANY: ABOUT SVG MAP FILES

There are two sets of SVG maps in this directory:

1. Master: The New England counties map was originally obtained from a
public-domain map from Wikipedia Commons, with various tweaks made using
Inkscape.

The North America map was made from another public-domain map from Wikimedia
Commons, extended with the southern portions of eight Canadian provinces in
order to show coverage of a bit of more of North America, and also with U.S.
county lines removed in order to show data at the state level only.
province level.

- new-england-counties.svg
- north-america.svg

Two of the maps are earlier versions of the North America map: one shows
U.S. counties (similar to or the same as the Wikimedia Commons map), and
the same map extended with the southern portions of Canadian provinces:

- us-counties.svg *
- north-america-counties.svg *

* = not currently in use on the Go Botany site

2. Scoured: Files resulting from running the master files through an
open-source Python SVG cleanup script called Scour, available at:
    http://www.codedread.com/scour/
These scoured files are NOT editable in Inkscape.

- new-england-counties-scoured.svg
- north-america-scoured.svg

- us-counties-scoured.svg *
- north-america-counties-scoured.svg *

* = not currently in use on the Go Botany site


NOTE: At this point the master maps will not work properly when mapping
actual distribution data with the Go Botany API code. Always generate and
use the scoured version when developing and testing with the code and data.


EDITING THE MAPS

If you need to edit the map files, do so on the master versions and then
generate new scoured versions by running Scour.


RUNNING SCOUR

Run scour.py one file at a time. Set the -i switch to the master input
filename and the -o switch to the scoured output filename. Include the
following configuration options for the Go Botany maps. The command should
look like those show below. They should be all on one line, and you should
add directory paths to the Scour script and the input and output files as
needed.

For generating the New England counties scoured map (and the no-longer-used
U.S. counties scoured map):

$ python {path/to/}scour.py -i {path/to/}new-england-counties.svg
-o {path/to/}new-england-counties-scoured.svg --disable-style-to-xml
--indent=none --enable-comment-stripping --set-precision=4

For generating the North America scoured map, leave off the --set-precision
switch, and add the --remove-metadata switch, like this:

$ python {path/to/}scour.py -i {path/to/}us-counties.svg
-o {path/to/}us-counties-scoured.svg --disable-style-to-xml --indent=none
--enable-comment-stripping --remove-metadata

The previously included --set-precision=4 somehow fouled the alignment of
the U.S. state lines following the Canada additions. Leaving it off (default
precision = 5) fixes this.
