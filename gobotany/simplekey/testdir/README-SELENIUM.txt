Running Functional Tests With Selenium
======================================

Install the latest release of ChromeDriver, from:

https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/

This involves unzipping the archive, then copying the file `chromedriver`
to the proper location for the platform. (For Mac: /usr/local/bin/)

Note that for the most part, the Go Botany browser tests assume a fully
populated database for the site including all plant data.

Against a local browser
-----------------------

The easiest way to run these functional tests is like this:

    $ dev/test-browser

Or, per class or test:

    $ dev/test-browser SearchSuggestionsFunctionalTests

    $ dev/test-browser \
        SearchSuggestionsFunctionalTests.test_plant_synonym_suggestions_exist

Against a remote browser
------------------------

If you want to run a standalone Selenium server the old-fashioned way -
maybe to allow IE on a Windows machine to be driven by the test suite
running on Linux or Mac OS - then on the machine with the browser you
want to test you can run:

  $ java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.0b3.jar -browserSessionReuse

The standalone server will print out a URL that you can then supply to
your tests through an environment variable:

  $ SELENIUM=http://127.0.0.1:4444/wd/hub \
      bin/unit2 gobotany.simplekey.test.test_fbasic

The latest version of Selenium Standalone Server can be found at:

Hitting sites other than localhost
----------------------------------

Either of the above commands can be supplemented with a `SIMPLEHOST`
environmental variable to make them look for the web application to be
running somewhere other than `localhost:8000` which is where the tests
expect it by default.  Just prepend either of the above command lines
with something like:

  $ SIMPLEHOST=192.168.1.5:8000 ...

Or, you could even point the test suite directly at the live site:

  $ SIMPLEHOST=gobotany.nativeplanttrust.org ...

Running your tests using Sauce Labs
-----------------------------------

Finally, if you want to use Sauce Labs to run your suite, then you can
provide the remote URL in your `SELENIUM` environment variable.  So you
could run Sauce Labs against our EC2 instance by running something like
this:

  $ SELENIUM=http://your_username:7ae65a2a-925f-db4d-925f-4d2b7e5e1b33@ondemand.saucelabs.com:80/wd/hub \
      SIMPLEHOST=simplekey.newfs.org \
      bin/unit2 gobotany.simplekey.test.test_fbasic

If you want Sauce to hit the server running on your localhost (but be
warned that this can be very slow unless you are on a network with a
fast uplink back to the Internet, which will cost testing time for your
Sauce Labs account!), then use the `sauce_connect` application to tell
your Sauce hosts to redirect that hostname back to your local machine
over an SSH tunnel:

  ./sauce_connect -u USERNAME -k KEY -s localhost -p 8000 \
    -d simplekey.org -t 80

Then just tell the tests to hit that fake domain name you just
established over at Sauce Labs:

  $ SELENIUM=... SIMPLEHOST=simplekey.org \
      bin/unit2 gobotany.simplekey.test.test_fbasic
