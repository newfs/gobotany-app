    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Go Botany is designed to gather and disseminate information about plant
    distribution and abundance across the six states of New England, USA, and 
    adjacent provinces and states. This privacy policy governs the use of
    personal information from the site and you agree to be bound to this
    policy as a user of the Site.</p>
    
    <h2>Submitted information</h2>

    <p>Personal Information is voluntarily supplied by you when you register
    and submit data to the PlantShare sector 
    of the Site. By registering at PlantShare, you allow us to associate your
    plant observations with a unique identifier (login name or your name), so
    that you can track your personal observations (e.g., checklists and
    customized maps). Profile Information allows us to gain a better 
    understanding of the PlantShare participants and Go Botany visitors and to
    determine how best to improve the web site for Go Botany users.</p>

    <p>You are able to view your personal observations (plant sightings,
    postings, and questions to the Botanist) and those of others (if they have
    made them available to you, your affinity group, or the web), so please be
    aware that your observations of species and their locations plus an 
    supporting information you provide, may be available to other PlantShare
    users.</p>

    <p>Plant observations are the most important pieces of information that we
    collect. Details of a plant sighting and its associated location (species,
    numbers, etc.) are available only to the users designated by you as a 
    PlantShare member, which you choose upon uploading a sighting to the Site.
    Only information pertaining to plant observations is available to your
    selected users; no personal contact information is ever made public.</p>

    <p>Cookies are pieces of data that we store on your computer to tie your
    information to the PlantShare program. Cookies allow you to store your
    login information, so that you will not be required to log in each time
    you visit the PlantShare web site.</p>
                    
    <p>Internet browsers allow you to determine whether or not to accept
    cookies (check under the preferences or options in the browser menu). If
    you decide not to accept cookies, you can still use the PlantShare site, 
    but you will need to re-enter login information each time you visit.</p>
                    
    <h2>Sensitive species</h2>
                    
    <p>If you submit an unusual observation or a sighting of a plant known to
    be listed as Endangered, Threatened, Special Concern, Historic or Invasive
    in a New England state, we may e-mail you to request more details and to 
    confirm your sighting. Your e-mail address and contact information will
    not be sold or distributed outside Native Plant Trust.</p>
                    
    <h2>Your practices in obtaining sightings</h2>
                    
    <p>As a conservation organization, Native Plant Trust seeks
    to limit disturbance to plants, especially those that are rare or occur on
    private property. Please do not trespass on private property to observe
    plants; always obtain landowner permission before gathering data on plants
    and posting sightings from private property. By posting a sighting, you
    are agreeing that all applicable landowner permissions have been obtained
    and that posting of locational and other data has been approved by the 
    landowner.</p>
                    
    <h2>Changes to this privacy policy</h2>
                    
    <p>We may occasionally update or amend Native Plant Trustâ€™s
    Privacy Statement. If we make changes, we will post the changes here.</p>
