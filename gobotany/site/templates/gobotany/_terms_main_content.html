                adjacent provinces and states.  This privacy policy

                and you agree to be bound to this policy as a user of 
                the Site.</p>
                
            <h3>Submitted information</h3>
    
            <p>Personal Information is voluntarily supplied by you 
                when you register and submit data to the <a

                associate your plant observations with a unique identifier 
                (login name or your name), so that you can track your 
                personal observations (e.g., checklists and customized 
                maps). Profile Information allows us to gain a better 
                understanding of the PlantShare participants and Go Botany 
                visitors and to determine how best to improve the web site 
                for Go Botany users.</p>
            
            <p>You are able to view your personal observations (plant 
                sightings, postings, and questions to the Botanist) and 
                those of others (if they have made them available to you, 
                your affinity group, or the web), so please be aware that 
                your observations of species and their locations plus an

                other PlantShare users.</p>
                
            <p>Plant observations are the most important pieces of 
                information that we collect. Details of a plant sighting 
                and its associated location (species, numbers, etc.) are 
                available only to the users designated by you as a 
                PlantShare member, which you choose upon uploading a 
                sighting to the Site.  Only information pertaining to

            <h3>Sensitive species</h3>
    
            <p>If you submit an unusual observation or a sighting of a 
                plant known to be listed as Endangered, Threatened, 
                Special Concern, Historic or Invasive in a New England 
                state, we may email you to request more details and to 
                confirm your sighting.  Your email address and contact 
                information will not be sold or distributed outside Native

            <h3>Your practices in obtaining sightings</h3>
            
            <p>As a conservation organization, Native Plant Trust
                seeks to limit disturbance to plants, especially 
                those that are rare or occur on private property. Please 
                do not trespass on private property to observe plants; 
                always obtain landowner permission before gathering data 
                on plants and posting sightings from private property.
                By posting a sighting, you are agreeing that all applicable 
                landowner permissions have been obtained and that posting 
                of locational and other data has been approved by the 
                landowner.</p>
